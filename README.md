## Overview
This project is an Electron app that  requires frontend setup. Follow the steps below to quickly clone and run the app using a simplified approach.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher)
- **npm** (v6.x or higher)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

## Steps to Get Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
```bash
cd <repo-name>
```

Now, install the dependencies for the project:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up the Frontend
Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `ui` folder and install the frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd ui
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Application
To run the app, execute the following command in the terminal inside the `ui` folder:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Run the Backend (if applicable)
If the backend needs to be run separately, follow the instructions provided in the respective section of this README.

## Additional Tips

- **Split Terminal**: You can use a terminal split to have both the frontend (`ui`) and backend running concurrently, making the development process faster.
  
### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues, make sure all dependencies are properly installed. If problems persist, check for errors in the console output and search for solutions based on the specific error message.
